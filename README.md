## GettingArchitectureDoneKit

Just-add-water utilities for Grasshopper for Rhino to perform design and architectural tasks with ease.

This library is part of the [Getting Architecture Done](http://www.gettingarchitecturedone.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=GADKit) project. Follow [@GettingArchDone](http://twitter.com/GettingArchDone) on Twitter or [Facebook](http://facebook.com/gettingarchitecturedone) to keep updated. Please, take a look at our architecture articles at [gettingarchitecturedone.com/writing](http://gettingarchitecturedone.com/writing).

## Usage

* Download the Grasshopper utilities.
* Drag a definition onto Grasshopper.

## Structure

The new structure of **GADKit** contains separated files for each utility and workflow - rather than wrapping all of the utilities in a single Grasshopper file. This way, the library is more transparent, and easier to explore, use, and maintain.

*All utilities and workflows in bold exist.*

### Utilities

A series of functions of frequent tasks as a shortcut or improvement of existing Grasshopper functionality.

* **GADCurveExtrude**
* **GADCurveOffset**
* **GADCurveThicken**
* **GADCurveWiggle**
* GADCurveSubCurveWithPoints
* GADGeometryColorGradient
* **GADGeometryExtrudeFromCenter**
* GADGeometrySort
* **GADLineFromCenter**
* **GADListRemoveExtremes**
* **GADPatternMaker**
* **GADPointOnPlane**
* **GADPeopleMaker**
* **GADRectangleFromCenter**

### Workflows

Ways to work. Already built in separate workflows.

* **GADWorkflowDictionary**
* **GADWorkflowBake**
